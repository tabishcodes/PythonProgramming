#STRING METHODS
print(num.isdecimal()) #returns true if the all the characters are decimal (0-9) else false.
print("\u0030".isdecimal()) #returns true if the value of the unicode is a number.
print(num.isdigit()) #same as isdecimal but exponents like Â² (power value), are also considered to be a digit.
print("q adc".isidentifier()) #returns true is a string contains alphanumeric letters (a-z) and (0-9), or underscores (_) but it cannot start with a number, or contain any spaces in start or inbetween.
print(num.isdecimal()) #returns true if the string contains all numeric values (0-9) with no decimal point, negative value, power value or rational value.
print(num.isprintable()) #returns true if the values are printable else false
print(num.isspace()) #returns true if all the charcters in the string is whitespaces
print("#$".join(num)) #return the string with joined iterable in between. Syntax- string.join(iterable)
